# cspy (Q-Scope)

A tool for scanning interactions with a tangible grid of acrylic plates, based on the MIT's [CityScoPy](https://cityscope.media.mit.edu/docs/TUI/CityScoPy). It is used in the [Q-Scope Project](q-scope.readthedocs.io) of the [Department of Resilient Energy Systems](www.uni-bremen.de/res).


## Adjustments:

- enhanced using parts of [HCU CSL Code]()
- reads from tagged acrylic plates instead of black and white LEGO
- can read values of optical sliders
- offers some more tools to tweak the image (like added grayscale layer) and thus improves detection accuracy
